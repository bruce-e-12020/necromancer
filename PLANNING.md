# PLANNING

## Steps for Every Stage of Project

1. Write a set of tasks in TASKS.md.
    --Mark each task complete as they are completed.
2. Create unit tests for every function and class created. Every new function and class should have a set of tests ready to go.
3. Run tests whenever the code changes. Rewrite tests if code change warrants it.
4. Update repo and version number regularly. 
    --Use branching to add new functionality.
